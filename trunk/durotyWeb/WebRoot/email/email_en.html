		Before you can send the mail like
		<b>${email}</b>, we needed to verify that you have access to this direction.
		<br />
		<br />
		To make the verification it uses the following direction
		<br />
		<br />
		<a href="${url}" target="_blank">${url}</a>
		<br />
		<br />
		In case the previous URL does not work copy and paste in a window of your navigator
